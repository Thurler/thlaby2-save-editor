# Touhou Labyrinth 2 Save Editor

This repository provides a save editor for Touhou Labyrinth 2, capable of editing many of the event flags and character stats in your save file, among other things. Unlike editing a raw hex file, which would require computing the correct offsets and hexadecimal convertions, this program aims to provide an intuitive interface for each piece of data in the save file:

TODO: Insert some pictures here?

The editor is compatible with both the legacy save format (from the Comiket version, available through DLSite) and the Steam save format. You can also choose which format to export your edited save to, so this tool also works as a converter between formats.
